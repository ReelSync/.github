**Scalable Video Metadata Management System**

ReelSync is a modular system for managing, processing, and storing metadata associated with video content. It is designed as a solo development project focused on practical implementation, technical learning, and AI-assisted development.

---

## 📁 Current Components

- **ReelSync Database**  
  PostgreSQL-based metadata storage and management layer.

- **ReelSync Metadata Agent** *(Planned)*  
  A metadata extraction tool using SQLite for temporary storage.

---

## 🚀 Development Workflow

ReelSync follows a **trunk-based development workflow** for simplicity and efficiency:

- Work is done directly on the `main` branch
- Frequent, small commits for stability and easier debugging
- Early testing integration and minimal process overhead

---

## 💻 Development Environment & Tooling

- **OS:** macOS  
- **Tools:** Xcode, JetBrains Toolbox  
- **Tooling Preference:** Low-cost or open-source options

---

## 🔐 Security Considerations

- **Access Control:** RBAC, API authentication, OAuth (explored as needed)
- **Data Storage:** PostgreSQL encryption, secure metadata handling
- **API Security:** Input validation, SQL injection protection, rate-limiting (potential)
- **Deployment:** Docker security best practices, secrets management

---

## 🧪 Testing Strategy

- **Unit Testing:** Focus on database operations, extraction logic
- **Integration Testing:** Ensures interoperability between components
- **Goal:** Gradual introduction of automated pipelines (initially manual testing)

---

## 🔄 CI/CD & Deployment

- **Version Control:** Git + GitHub
- **Planned Enhancements:**
  - GitHub Actions for automation
  - CI/CD integration as testing matures
  - Potential use of Kubernetes/Nomad for orchestration if scaling requires it

---

## 🤖 Role of AI in Development

AI tools are core to the ReelSync workflow, especially in:

- **Research:** Best practices for database, automation, deployment
- **Development:** Code generation, debugging, and refactoring
- **Testing:** Identifying testing frameworks and automation strategies
- **Documentation:** Reducing the burden of manual documentation

This project also serves as an experiment in **AI-assisted software development**.

---

## 📚 Technical Background

Although the project includes new technologies, the developer brings:

- **SQL Experience:** Strong background in SQL Server & T-SQL  
  *(PostgreSQL is new and being learned during this project)*  
- **Scripting & Development:** Shell scripting, .NET, Python, JavaScript, Rust  
- **Version Control:** Comfortable with Git, exploring GitHub workflows

---

## 📌 Project Philosophy

- Prioritize **learning, experimentation**, and **practical results**
- Favor **depth and precision** over brevity
- Be open to **new tools and methodologies**
- Use AI to **accelerate and augment** development

---

## 🛠️ Guidelines for AI-Assisted Collaboration

All AI-generated or AI-assisted responses should aim to be:

- **Accurate & Up-to-Date**
- **Technically Detailed**
- **Contextually Relevant**
- **Exploratory & Innovative**

---

## 📅 Maintenance Notes

This document serves as the **core README** and will be updated as the project evolves.
